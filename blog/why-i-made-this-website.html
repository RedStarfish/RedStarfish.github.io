      <h2>Why I Have Made This Website</h2>

      <p>
	I think this post, telling you why I've made this website, would be
	most appropriate as the first post.
      </p>
      <p>
	As most of my fellow GNU users and free software enthusiasts agree
	that, the state of current internet is very poor. The internet and
	the World Wide Web(WWW) is controlled by the 5 corporations(GAFAM),
	but especially by the Google. As Google's chromium has monopoly in
	the browser market, whatever it is implementing, is becoming a "web
	standard". Also websites are very bloated nowadays. Many website
	lose functionality when you block javascript(and you should). They
	hardly works with text based browsers. We also don't see people
	having their own website like they used to have. Mostly they spend
	their time on Facebook and Twitter(and other such proprietary social
	medial platforms). The way Facebook/Twitter is using these people
	for their own gain is outrageous (to quote Richard Stallman:
	Facebook has no user, it has 'used'). They are even influencing
	elections.(By the way,
	fediverse/<a href="https://joinmastodon.org">Mastodon</a> are very
	good solutions to Facebook/Twitter)
      </p>
      <p>
	Few months ago I saw a youtube video from the youtuber known
	as <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz">Luke Smith</a>. He makes GNU,
	Linux and free software related videos. In that video he was telling
	how easy and important it is to have your own website. So from then
	on I had a desire to have my own website. Before that I used to
	think, having website is too hard and money consuming. But I had zero
	knowledge about managing websites. I knew some basic HTML and CSS,
	and that was all. Also as I was very busy at that time, I decided to
	let the matter drop.
      </p>
      <p>
	But yesterday, suddenly a thought came to me(an itch?). I had known
	about Github pages all along but never considered using it because I
	have serious problems with both Github and Microsoft(the company
	which owns it). Then I considered, while using Github pages I am not
	forcing people to use proprietary software. This whole site is made
	up of HTML and CSS. So having this website is not immoral, and I can
	totally have it. It'll also give me experience about how to make
	websites. Most importantly I have enough free time now to play with
	it. So yesterday evening, I started building this website.<br/>
	Previously I had some basic interaction with Git, then I read some
	posts about how to use Github pages, and realized, it was not that
	hard. I also had come across a site whose style sheet I liked. I
	copied it, made some minor modification and make it look red instead
	of purple(that website was under CC BY-SA), so here is the
	result. The fact that you can see the source of any website you
	visit is really helpful.
      </p>
      <p>
	I also wanted to have RSS feeds in my website. RSS feeds are a great
	way to follow websites without any 3rd party meddling and for that
	reason it is a must have for me. So I spend another half hour
	learning how to do it and I am really surprised by how easy it is to
	set up. I wish more websites would use it.
      </p>
      <p>
	I think this is enough for the first post, GNU Emacs tells me we
	have already crossed 600 words. And I don't want readers to lose
	attention midway while reading this.
      </p>
