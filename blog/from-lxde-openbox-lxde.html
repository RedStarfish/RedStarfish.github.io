	<h3 id="intro">First Interactions with LXDE</h3>
	
	<p>
	  My first experience
	  with <a href="https://www.lxde.org/">LXDE</a> (By default
	  LXDE uses Openbox but you don't get the right click menu,
	  autostart or enviroment that defines openbox) came with
	  <a href="https://trisquel.info">Trisquel Mini</a>. I wanted
	  to use Trisquel(8) and it came with two editions MATE and
	  LXDE. I saw no point in installing Trisquel using a larger
	  ISO when I was going to customize it, use my own choice of
	  applications and not going to use the default ones provided
	  as default by Trisquel. Also I knew that what desktop
	  enviroment comes pre-installed doesn't matter because I can
	  always install the one I want, later.
	</p>
	<p>
	  So, I went with LXDE edition, thinking that I'd install XFCE
	  later after installation. But when using XFCE, I kept coming
	  back to LXDE (with Trisquel theme) mainly because it was
	  lightweight and felt snappier. I also changed some
	  keybindings to suit my needs. But few things I liked (and
	  still like) from XFCE were:
	  <ul>
	    <li>xfce4-appfinder</li>
	    <li>xfce4-notifyd</li>
	    <li>xfce4-pulseaudio-plugin - <em>Really useful</em></li>
	    <li>xfce4-screenshooter</li>
	  </ul>
	  
	  So while using LXDE (trisquel themed), I was using used some
	  components from xfce4 too.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  After few months as Trisquel 8 was getting really old, I
	  decided to move to <a href="https://parabola.nu">Parabola
	  GNU/Linux-libre</a> (Note: If you want to use Trisquel, you
	  should install Trisquel 9). Here my first instinct again was
	  to install LXDE, but after installation I didn't like it. So
	  I immediately installed xfce4 again. I was really surprised
	  how much progress it had gone through in the last 3-4
	  years. But I became increasingly frustrated as my preferred
	  keybindings (which I created while using Trisquel) were not
	  there, so I started using LXDE again with above mentioned
	  xfce4 programs.
	</p>

	<h3 id="openbox">From LXDE To Openbox</h3>
	<p>
	  While above mentioned things were happening, I tried using
	  the vanilla Openbox few times, but as it's so minimalist and
	  I didn't know what additional softwares to use, I exited
	  Openbox within 5 minutes everytime logged into a
	  openbox-session.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Then I found this really great
	  <a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/openbox-fedora/">Fedora
	    Magazine article</a>. This helped me a lot to move towards
	    using Openbox. Openbox session became usable to me.
	</p>
	<p>
	  One thing I noticed, standalone LXDE programs were making
	  openbox more complete but few things weren't working out for
	  me in Openbox, for example:
	  <ul>
	    <li>Screen wasn't locking immediately after I closed the
	      Laptop lid.</li>
	    <li>
	      No Trash support.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      External drive wasn't mounting automatically, I needed to
	      use CLI and become root to work with external drive. Even
	      root couldn't change the permissions or ownership of the
	      files in the external drives.
	    </li>
	  </ul>

	  So these things kept bugging me. On one hand, I wanted to go
	  back to LXDE and on the other, I liked the tint2 panel
	  instead of lxpanel, I wanted the right click menu of
	  openbox, nitrogen for setting wallpapers etc.
	</p>
	<h3 id="lxde-openbox">Using LXDE/Openbox</h3>
	<p>
	  I decided to go back to LXDE (lxsession) but with a twist. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  To use my preferred panel and get back the Openbox's right
	  click menu, I found that these things are being controlled
	  by LXDE's autostart file. This file is located at
	  <code>
	    /home/user/.config/lxsession/LXDE/autostart
	  </code>.  Once I got to this file, stripping things were
	  very easy. LXDE's right click and wallpaper is controlled by
	  pcmanfm in desktop mode. I changed it to daemon mode. That
	  way I got back Openbox's right click menu.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  I removed the lxpanel and replaced with tint2. This way, I
	  could use tint2 in LXDE instead having to lxpanel.
	</p>

	<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
	<p>
	  So, this is the long tale of how I've found the desktop the
	  way I want. Which is the full functionality of Openbox
	  complemented by LXDE programs.

	<h3 id="helping">Helping You</h3>
	<p>
	  If you want to have your desktop just like I have. Do the
	  following:
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      Clone my Dotfiles repository. Here you'll find all
	      the necessary configuration files.<br/>
	      <code>$ git clone
		https://codeberg.org/Red_Starfish/My_Dotfiles.git</code>
	      
	    </li>
	    <br/>
	    <li>
	      In the openbox directory, you'll find the following files:
	      <ol>
		<li>lxde-rc.xml - Put it in
		  <code>~/.config/openbox/lxde-rc.xml</code></li>
		<li>menu.xml - Put it in <code>~/.config/openbox/menu.xml</code></li>
		<li>autostart - Put it in
		  <code>~/.config/lxsession/LXDE/autostart</code></li>
		<li>tint2rc - Put it
		  in <code>~/.config/tint2/tint2rc</code> 
		  <br/>
		  (make sure you have tint2 installed though.)</li>
	      </ol>
	    </li>
	    <br/>
	    <li>You will find some awesome wallpapers from here:<br/>
	      <code>
		$ git clone https://gitlab.com/dwt1/wallpapers.git
	      </code>
	      <br/><br/>You'll need something like nitrogen to set wallpapers.
	    </li>
	    <br/>
	    <li>
	      Next time you login, login to LXDE session.
	    </li>
	  </ul>
